<h1><span>8.2</span> Identify who your stakeholders are and plan how you will communicate with them </h1>

<div class="content-left">

<p>The communication strategy also depends on your data release, for example, who has access to the data.</p> 

<p>Make sure you know how much you want to explain about your <strong>anonymisation methodology</strong>. As a guideline, the more you are comfortable to release without affecting the disclosure risk, the better. For example, you want to tell users that you have added noise to a variable and, as much as possible, how this affected the variable. Of course, you cannot disclose the exact amount of noise.</p>

<p>Why and how the release is useful for people should also be reflected in your communication strategy.</p>
