<h1><span>1.1</span> Describing the data environment</h1>

<div class="content-left">
<p>The process of anonymising data relies on a careful consideration of the data environment. The data environment is, in a broad sense, the context. This could be people who are interested in the data, other related datasets, or processes that interact with the data.</p>
<p>For example, you release an open dataset on expenses. Then, considerations of the data environment are at least 
</p>

<ul>
	<li>all people who have access to the internet, </li>
	<li>journalists who are are looking for a story on transparency, </li>
	<li>expense datasets from previous years, </li>
	<li>the internal people who access the dataset before it is anonymised,</li>
</ul>

<p>and so forth.</p>
