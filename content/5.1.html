<h1><span>5.1</span> Understand the issue of consent and your ethical obligations</h1>

<div class="content-left">
	
	<p>When you collect data, even if you plan to use that data for research purposes it is always preferable to obtain consent for this. Not least because it is thought that gaining consent has a consequential effect that will promote both trust in your organisation and the continued support of your data subjects.</p>


	<h2>About Consent</h2>
	
	<p>Consent is derived from the principle of autonomy. In the data context this translates to enabling data subjects to have some say in how data about them is used, even when it is anonymised.<br /> </br />
Consent - as in ‘informed consent’ requires that it is voluntary, given in full knowledge and given by someone with capacity to consent. <br /> <br />
Consent is sometimes confused with notification. A statement about the planned use of data may leave people no option but to agree because they cannot otherwise access the data product or service. This is not informed consent but a form of notification</p> 
	
	<h2>When consent is not possible</h2>
	
	<p>
		Sometimes it is not possible to obtain consent for secondary use of anonymised data because for example you collected your data too long ago or the cost of doing so is prohibitive. The Data Protection Act (1998) offers provision for this situation. Section 33(2) stipulates, <br /> <br />
<em>For the purposes of the second data protection principle, the further processing of personal data only for research purposes in compliance with the relevant conditions is not to be regarded as incompatible with the purposes for which they were obtained.</em>
