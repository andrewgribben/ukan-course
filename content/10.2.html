<h1><span>10.2</span> Plan what happens next once you have shared or released data</h1>

<div class="content-left">
	
	<p class="ignore">Revisit on a regular basis data that you have shared or released. It is good practice to periodically reconsider both its risk and usefulness.
	<br /><br />
At the very least, you should:
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Keep a register of all the data your share or release.</li>
		<li>Consider any new shares and releases against previous shares and releases.</li>
		<li>Scan the data environment by looking at such as -
			<ul>
				<li>Other similar data released by organisations in your sector</li>
				<li>Publicly available data sources </li>
				<li>How your data is being used and by whom</li>
			</ul>
		</li>  
	</ul>
