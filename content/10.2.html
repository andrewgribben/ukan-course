<h1><span>10.2</span> Plan what you will do if things go wrong</h1>

<div class="content-left">
	<p>Anticipating a data breach you will give you some control over its initial and long-term impact on your stakeholders and yourself.</p>

	<p>If a breach were to occur you will need to:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>be able to provide a clear data audit trail</li>
		<li>have a robust review process that identifies what went wrong and prevents a recurrence</li>
		<li>start a crisis management process that helps you talk to your stakeholders</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Thinking through step by step what you would do if there were a breach will help ensure you have considered all the important factors. </strong></p>

	<p>The types of things you need to think about include such as:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>What immediate measure would I need to undertake to prevent further breaches e.g. do I need to remove my data from the web and if so how will I go about doing this?</li>
		<li>Which external organisations and individuals would I need to notify and how should I do this?</li>
		<li>How would I interact with the person or organisation who is involved in/created the breach?</li>
		<li>Are all my data handling, data sharing and release policies and procedures robust enough?</li>
	</ul>
