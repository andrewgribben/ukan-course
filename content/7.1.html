	<p>
	Anonymising data is an iterative process. There are many methods that allow you to obscure or aggregate data. In some cases you may want to restrict access. The key is to recognise that the technical work is only a part of the anonymisation process.
	</p>
	
	<p>
Every anonymisation process depends on the data situation at hand. We will show a few techniques with the help of the Titanic passenger data. However, remember that this is only one step out of ten within the anonymisation decision-making framework. Depending on the scenario, you may reach a different decision, even with the same dataset.

	<p>
The Titanic passenger data describes the survival status of individual passengers on the Titanic. It has 1309 passengers (rows) and 14 variables (columns). The variables are characteristics such as name, age, travel companion or how much they paid for the ticket.
