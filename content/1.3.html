<h1><span>1.3</span> Describing the data environment</h1>

<div class="content-left">

<p>For you to be able to describe your data situation is it best to think about the situation from the point at which the data is collection to the point at which it will be shared or released. A data situation might be relatively straight forward involving the movement of data from one environment to another but commonly it can be more complex than this involving the movement of data across multiple environments. Let us consider this issue further using an example.</p> 
 
<strong><p>Example 1 Data situation: Data flow between 2 environments</p></strong>   
<p>Organisation X collects data from its customers on public transport usage, it wishes to share an anonymised version of the data with its Local Authority (LA) to support the LA provision of public transport. This is environment 1.</p> 

</div>

<div class="content-right">

<p>The LA has signed a data sharing agreement with Organisation X to analysis the data for the purpose for which it is given, to hold the data no longer than the agreed time period and to safely destroy it thereafter. This is environment 2. </p>

<p>What happens within and across the environments is the  data situation. Components 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the ADF will help you understand and identify the critical issues you will need to think about when describing your data situation. These include: your data, legal and governance issues as well as issues of data subject consent and ethics.</p>
