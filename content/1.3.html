<p>Busmapper Ltd. collects data from its customers on public transport use. It wishes to share an anonymised version of the data with the Local Authority (LA) to support the LA provision of public transport. This is environment 1.</p> 
 
<p>The LA has signed a data sharing agreement with Busmapper Ltd. to analyse the data. This is environment 2.</p>
