	<h1><span>0.3</span> The Anonymisation Decision-Making Framework</h1>

	<div class="content-left">
		
	<p>The ADF can be used at three levels, as:</p>

<div class="cool-ol">	
	<ol>
		<li><p>A tool for knowledge development.</p></li>
		<li><p>A tool to help you understand your <span id="data-situation" class="highlight">data situation</span>.</p></li>
		<li><p>A practical tool to support your anonymisation decision-making.</p></li>
	</ol>

</div>


<p class="hidden-p ignore">A data situation describes a situation where data are moved from at least one environment to another. Data shares and releases can be described as data situations. In both cases data is moved from at least one data custodian ( an environment) to a partners organisation or group of users (another environment). How a data custodian has come by the data, the data itself, what role and responsibilities the data custodian(s) has and to whom, whether it shares and or releases products of that data and how it does this all come together to create particular data situations.</p>

<div class="content-right">
	<h2>How you use the ADF should be related to your level of knowledge and skills.</h2>
	<p>This is because anonymisation is not an exact science and to use it at level 3, you will need to make complex judgement calls about when data is sufficiently anonymised given your data situation. The Anonymisation Decision-making Framework will help you in making sound decision based on best practice. However, it can only do this within the context of the knowledge and skills you bring to applying it.. Where necessary, you should seek advice from appropriate experts.</p>
