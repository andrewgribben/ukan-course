<h1><span>6.1</span> Know the processes you will need to go through to assess disclosure risk</h1>

	<p>
	The key question is - how might a data breach actually occur?  
	<br /> <br />
	To assess how a data breach might occur - we recommend that you follow steps1 and 2.  Step 3 is both informative and good practice but resource intensive and thus we recognise it is not an option that everyone can undertake. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	
	The steps are as follows:</p>
	
	<ol class="no_bullets">
		<li><strong>Step 1. Assess the data in front of you</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Step 2. Scenario analysis</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Step 3. Testing assumptions of scenarios</strong></li>
	</ol>
