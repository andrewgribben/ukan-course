<h1><span>6.3</span> Know the processes you will need to go through to anonymise your data</h1>

	<h2>Step 2.  Scenario analysis – getting to know your data within the share/release environment</h2>
	
	<p>
	Apply the information from step 1 ‘know your data’ to consider if your data is at risk in respect to:  	</p>
	
	<ol >
		<li>other relevant external data sources</li>
		<li>potential intruders </li>
		<li>likelihood of an attempt  of attack on dataset</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p class="ignore">
This information will help you establish <strong>relevant plausible scenarios for your data situation</strong>. When you undertaking scenario analysis you are essentially considering the how, who and why of a potential breach.</p>
	

	<h2>An example of a scenario analysis framework</h2>
	
	<div class="hide_me">
	<ul>
	<li><span class="underline">Scenario description</span>: Specify a brief summary of the event.
	<li><span class="underline">Rationale</span>: Specify what lies behind the event, i.e.: (i) malicious intent, (ii) non-compliance with data security policies and procedures, (iii) error.</li>
	<li><span class="underline">Likelihood of the scenario</span>: Specify what factor if any may influence the likelihood of the event such as easier ways of obtaining ‘the data’ or legal penalties or employee training and support to ensure compliance.</li>
	<li><span class="underline">Mitigation</span>: Specify what if any action you can take in order to reduce the risk of the event in terms of its likelihood or its impact.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Key question to help you develop plausible scenarios include:</p>
	
	<ol >
		<li>Who is interested in attacking your data?</li>
		<li>Why are they interested?</li>
		<li>Are there other ways for them to get access to such information?</li>
		<li>What other data would they need to re-identify someone in my anonymised dataset?</li>
		<li>What might be the impact or consequences?</li>
		<li>Into which scenarios should I invest my resources?</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Finding other external data sources </h2>
	
	<div  class="hide_me">
		<p>
			Below are examples of other sources of data that you may want to consider when developing your scenarios of disclosure. </p>	
		<p><em>Public sources of data</em>: This includes such as public registers, professional registers, electoral register, land registry, estate agents lists, newspaper reports, archived reports and announcements, parish records, vital statistics such as birth, death and marriage records.
		</p>
		<p><em>Other similar data releases</em>: This includes such as releases from your partner organisations and other organisations in your industry or sectors</p>
		<p><em>Official data releases</em>: 
		This includes such as data releases from the Office for National Statistics, Government departments and agencies and Local Authorities.
		</p>
		<p><em>Restricted access data sources</em>: This includes such as social media networks and potentially any other organisation collecting data
