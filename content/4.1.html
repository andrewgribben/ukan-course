	<p class="ignore">Before you anonymise your data you will be processing personal data and therefore will need to understand your responsibilities under the Data Protection Act (1998). </p>

<p><strong>What is the Data Protection Act (1998)?</strong></p>

<p>The Data Protection Act covers the processing of data of identifiable living individuals (personal data) and requires consideration of "likelihood of identification". The DPA does not require anonymisation to be completely risk free – the risk of identification should be negligible. 
<br />
<br />
In the UK some courts use the "likely, reasonably" test. You should make all reasonable attempts to limit the likelihood of identification, where necessary seek advice from experts such as UKAN and/or seek appropriate legal advice. Ensure this process is documented and kept up-to-date. In this course we recommend UKAN’s anonymisation decision-making framework. </p>
