<h2>Ethical considerations</h2> 

<p><strong>Professional ethics</strong> should dictate that you treat people with respect, which means doing all you can to avoid harm. Ethical guidelines and codes of conduct that apply to statisticians should also apply to data publishers. For example, the Office for National Statistics Code of Practice speaks of “serving the public good”.</p>

<p>What this means in practice is that you should bear in mind what impact the (anonymised) data you share or release might have both in terms of how it might be used and in terms of how the data subject might feel about how it is used. Indeed the ICO makes the point that, the fact that data is not personal data does not mean you can always disclose it  (see Anonymisation: managing data protection risk Code of Practice, 2012).</p> 

<p><strong>The key point here is that you should do no harm.</strong></p>
