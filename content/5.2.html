<h1><span>5.2</span> Understand the issue of consent and your ethical obligations</h1>

<div class="content-left">
	
<em>The key ethical obligation is that you should do no harm.</em>

<h2>Most professions have ethical guidelines</h2> 

<p class="ignore">Professional ethics should dictate that you treat people with respect, which means doing all you can to avoid harm. Ethical guidelines and codes of conduct that apply to statisticians should also apply to data publishers. For example, the Office for National Statistics <a href="http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/assessment/code-of-practice/code-of-practice-for-official-statistics.pdf">Code of Practice</a> speaks of “serving the public good”.</p>

<h2>You should bear in mind what impact the data release might have</h2>
<p class="ignore">
In practice the (anonymised) data you share or release might have an impact on the data subject or how they feel about how it is used. The ICO makes the point that even anonymised data does not mean you can always disclose it when you take into account ethical considerations. (See ICO <a href="http://ico.org.uk/for_organisations/data_protection/topic_guides/anonymisation">Anonymisation: managing data protection risk code of practice</a>).
