	<h2>Step 1. Assess the data in front of you</h2>
	<p>
You will already have largely covered this in the ‘Know your data’ section of the Anonymisation Decision-making Framework - to summarise you should be able to identify: </p>

<ul>
	<li>The type of data it is i.e. microdata or aggregate data </li>
	<li>The key variables in your data such as  - 
		<ul>
			<li>direct identifiers which are variables that are structurally unique for all persons in your data such as name. address and DOB or unique reference number </li> 
			<li>quasi-identifiers which are variables that are not structurally unique but are likely to be unique for a particular person in your data and the real world i.e. special uniques/risky records.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	
	<li>The properties of your dataset that are likely to affect the risk level associated with it such as its age, quality, sensitivity of your data (health data for example) as well as whether it is hierarchical, longitudinal and or population or  sample data
	</li>
</ul>
