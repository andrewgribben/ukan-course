	Anticipating a data breach you will give you some control over the initial and long-term impact on your stakeholders and yourself.
	<br />
	<br />
	
If a breach were to occur you will need:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>to be able to provide a clear data audit trail,</li>
	<li>have a robust review process that identifies what went wrong and prevents a reoccurrence, and</li>
	<li>launch a crisis management that helps you talk to your stakeholders.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Thinking through step by step what you would do if there were a breach will help ensure you have considered all the important factors.</strong></p>

	<p>The types of things you need to think about include such as:</p>
	<div class="hide_me">
	<ul>
	<li>What immediate measure would I need to undertake to prevent further breaches e.g. do I need to remove my data from the web and if so how will I go about doing this?</li>
	<li>Which external organisations and individuals would I need to notify and how should I do this?</li>
	<li>How would I interact with the person or organisation who is involved in/created the breach?</li>
	<li>Are all my data handling, data sharing and release policies and procedures robust enough?</li>
	</ul>
	</div>	<!-- Close hide_me -->
