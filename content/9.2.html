		If a breach were to occur you will need:
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li> To be able to provide a clear data audit trail </li>
		<li> A robust review process – to identify what went wrong and prevent a reoccurrence</li>
		<li> A crisis management policy – to help you talk to your stakeholders</li>
	</ul>

<p>
Thinking through step by step what you would do if there were a breach will help ensure you have considered all the important factors. The types of things you need to think about include such as:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>What immediate measure would I need to undertake to prevent further breaches e.g. do I need to remove my data from the web and if so how will I go about doing this?</li>
	<li>Which external organisations and individuals would I need to notify and how should I do this?</li>
	<li>How would I interact with the person or organisation who is involved in/created the breach?</li>
	<li>Are all my data handling, data sharing and release policies and procedures robust enough?</li>
</ul>

<p>
The key point is that - by dealing with a data breach in a proper, methodical, transparent and fair way you will have some control over the initial and long-term impact on your stakeholders and yourself.
