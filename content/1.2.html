<h1><span>1.2</span> Describing the data environment</h1>

<div class="content-left">
	<p>If you are publishing data as open data, for example the census, the data environment becomes very broad. It will also be much more difficult for you to manage this environment. Alternatively if you release data under restricted access conditions, the data environment is more contained and easier for you to manage . Thus you need to consider what data you share or release in relation to the share/release environment.
