<h1><span>1.2</span> Describe your data situation</h1>

<div class="content-left">
	<p>A data situation concerns the relationship between some data and their environment (s). Data situations can be static or dynamic. A static data situation is where there is no intentional movement of data between environments; a dynamic data situation is where there is such movement. By definition all data shares or dissemination processes are dynamic data situations; that is they describe a situation when data are moved from one environment to another.</p> 
 

	<h2>What do we mean by an environment?</h2>
<p>
It is in a broad sense, the context for data. It includes data, and other data, how people interact with that data and their responsibilities for it as well as the governance, socio-technical and legal infrastructure for processing and protecting it.</p>
