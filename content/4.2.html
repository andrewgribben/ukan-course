	<h2>How to ensure you meet your legal responsibilities</h2>
	
		<p>Having clearly defined governance structures and processes in your organisation will help you follow best practice in anonymisation as well as  meet your legal responsibilities.</p> 
		
		<p>Let us consider what we mean by <strong>Good Governance?</strong></p> 

		<p>Good Governance includes such as:</p>
		
		<ul>
			
			<li>Ensuring someone, within your organisation, with the suitable skills and knowledge has responsibility for authorising and overseeing the anonymisation process</li>
	        <li>Ensuring you have procedures for identifying cases where anonymisation may be problematic or difficult to achieve in practice</li>
	        <li>Ensuring you have a mechanism for clearly and accurately recording the anonymisation process (capturing who does what, when and how)</li>
	        <li>Conducting a Privacy impact assessment</li>
	        <li>Ensuring all staff are appropriately trained and that training is updated periodically</li>
	        <li>Know what to do if, in the rare event, things go wrong (discussed further on in the course)</li>
	        <li>Ensuring you keep up-to-date with any new guidance or case law that clarifies the legal framework surrounding anonymisation</li>

		</ul>
