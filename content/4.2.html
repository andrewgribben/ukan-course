	<p><strong>How to ensure you meet your legal responsibilities</strong></p>

		<p>Having clearly defined governance structures and processes in your organisation will help you follow best practice in anonymisation and meet your legal responsibilities. </p>

		<p>Let us consider what we mean by <strong>good governance</strong> for your organisation:</p>

		<ul>

		<li>Ensuring someone with the suitable skills and knowledge oversees the anonymisation process</li>
	    <li>Ensuring you have procedures for identifying cases where anonymisation may be problematic or difficult to achieve in practice</li>
	    <li>Documenting who does what, when and how and accurately record the anonymisation process</li>
	    <li>Conducting a privacy impact assessment</li>
	    <li>Training all staff appropriately and update training periodically</li>
	    <li>Knowing what to do if, in the rare event, things go wrong (discussed further on in the course)</li>
	    <li>Ensuring you keep up-to-date with any new guidance or case law that clarifies the legal framework surrounding anonymisation</li>

		</ul>
