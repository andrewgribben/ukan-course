<h1><span>3.1</span> Topic 3: The use case</h1>

<div class="content-left">
	
	<p>In determining the use case for your data you should capture three issues, they are:</p>
	
	<ol>  
	  	<li>Why you wish to share or release your data.</li>
	  	<li>Who will want to access your data.</li>  
	  	<li>How those accessing your data may want to use it.</li>
	</ol>
 
	<p>Your use case provides context to what data you should release and which release/share mechanism is most useful? For example if your core users want access to a particular variable you consider risky, you may need to restrict who has access to that data e.g. via accredited researchers. To meet your obligations to produce safe useful data you may decide to share with a wider audience via a license agreement by restricted a lot of the detail.</p>
