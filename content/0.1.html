	<h1><span>0.1</span> The Anonymisation Decision-Making Framework</h1>

	<div class="content-left">
	<p><em>Anonymisation is about managing risk.</em></p>
<p>The process of anonymising data involves a balance  between producing safe data and useful data. There is no such thing as zero risk but that is true in other areas of life as well.  Precautions are useful.  We donâ€™t say: fire safety measures are pointless because there are fires. When anonymisation is done well the risk of a data breach should be negligible.    </p>   

<p>This course has been developed by the UK Anonymisation Network (UKAN) based on the Anonymisation Decision-making Framework. A central tenet of the framework is that <em>we cannot carry out effective anonymisation by just looking at the data; the context is crucial.</em></p>
