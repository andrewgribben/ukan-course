<h1><span>5.3</span> Understand the issue of consent and your ethical obligations</h1>


	
<p><strong>Two examples that consider both legal and ethical considerations </strong></p>

<p><em>Example 1: Releasing (personal) data about deceased persons</em></p>

<p>You can legally publish data of deceased people (unless an exemption applies). However, this should not negate ethical considerations such as any distress you may cause to the relatives of the deceased persons by releasing such data.  
</p>  

<p>For further information and the list of exemptions see - Confidentiality guidance: Disclosure after a patient's death <a href='http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/ethical_guidance/confidentiality_70_72_disclosure_after_patient_death.asp' target="_blank">http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/ethical_guidance/confidentiality_70_72_disclosure_after_patient_death.asp</a></p>
