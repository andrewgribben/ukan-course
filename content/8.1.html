<h1><span>8.1</span> Know who your stakeholders are and how you will communicate with them</h1>

<div class="content-left">
	
	<p>
	How much do you want to explain of your anonymisation process? Who are you informing about your data release? Different audiences will need different communication strategies. Some people may want to learn about the benefits, while others care about your sound governance. 
	</p>
	<p>
	The communication strategy also depends on your data release, eg who has access to the data.
	<br /> <br />
	Possible stakeholders might be:
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>The data subjects, ie the people linked to the personal data</li>
		<li>Funding providers</li>
		<li>Users and researchers, accessing the datasets</li>
		<li>The general public, who might be concerned about your data release</li>
		<li>The regulators or related organisations</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
	Make sure you know how much you want to explain about your anonymisation methodology. As a guideline, the more you are comfortable to release without affecting the disclosure risk, the better. For example, you want to tell users that you have added noise to a variable and, as much as possible, how this affected the variable. Of course, you cannot disclose the exact amount of noise.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The why and how  the release is useful for people should be reflected in your communication strategy.
