	Your work is not done once you have shared or released a dataset. In other words you can not share or release and forget.
	The data environment is not static and overtime is very likely to change which could  impact on the risk level associated with your data.
	</p>
	<p>A few examples of how the data environment might change include:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>you release a new, more detailed version of the data</li>
		<li>you release additional and related data</li>
		<li>someone else releases related data</li>
		<li>you increase access to more users</li>
		<li>someone provides feedback about legal or ethical aspects</li>
		<li>the data is used in new ways</li>
	</ul>
