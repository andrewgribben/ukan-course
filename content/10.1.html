<h1><span>10.1</span> Plan what you will do if things go wrong</h1>

<div class="content-left">
	<p>Sometimes even when you follow all the recommended advice things can go wrong. The risk of disclosure is not zero (it should be negligible). </p>
<p>It is important that you put in place mechanisms that can help you deal with a data breach if, in the rare event, one were to occur.
</p>

<p>Developing a breaches policy should:</p>

<ul>
	<li>capture what you mean by a breach</li>
	<li>identify critical factors that might lead to a breach such as non-compliance, errors or malicious intrusion</li>
	<li>outline the penalties associated with a breach</li>
	<li>identify who is responsible for doing what, when and how</li>
</ul>
