	<h2>Step 3. Testing assumptions of scenarios considered in level 2: penetration testing.</h2>
	<p>
Penetration testing can be useful to validate assumptions by simulating attacks using “friendly” intruders. The ICO recommend carrying out a “motivated intruder test” as part of a practical assessment of a dataset’s risk.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Are there other sources of data that can be linked that haven’t been considered?</li>
		 <li>How easy is it to manipulate the data and find people in practice?</li>
		 <li>And related to the above, to gauge an approximate level of risk in the data.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
	For example, the statisticians at Department of Energy & Climate Change went through several tests for the national energy efficiency data. Even a prize was not claimed by a group of motivated post-graduate students in computer science.

	<p><em>The key is to document all steps you take to assess and protect against risk.</em></p>
