<p><strong>Two examples that consider both legal and ethical considerations </strong></p>

<p><em>Example 2: Releasing anonymised data</em></p>

<p>The Data Protection Act (1998) does not prevent the disclosure of anonymised data, however there may still be reasons for not disclosing it. For example, in cases where individuals, though not identifiable, are at risk of misidentification and where this misidentification may leads to harmful consequences.</p>

<p><strong>The key point is that you will need to consider both what you can do legally and what you should do ethically. Note that they may not be the same thing. Ethical considerations may override legal ones.</strong></p>
