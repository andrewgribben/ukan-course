	<p class="ignore">Sometimes even when you follow all the recommended advice things can go wrong. The risk of disclosure is not zero (it should be negligible). </p>

It is important that you put in place mechanisms that can help you deal with a data breach if, in the rare event, one were to occur.
<br />
<br />
Developing a <strong>breaches policy</strong> should:</p>

<ul>
	<li>capture what you mean by a breach,</li>
	<li>identify critical factors that might lead to a breach such as non-compliance, errors or malicious intrusion,</li>
	<li>outline the penalties associated with a breach,</li>
	<li>identify who is responsible for doing what, when and how. </li>
</ul>
