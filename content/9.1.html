	<p>Your work is not done once you have shared or released a dataset. In other words, <strong>you should not share/release and forget.</strong></p>
	
	<p>Any data environment is not static and over time is very likely to change. This could impact the risk level associated with your data. </p>

	<p>A few examples of how the data environment might change include:</p>


<ul>
	<li>you release a new, more detailed version of the data</li>
	<li>you release additional and related data</li>
	<li>someone else releases related data</li>
	<li>you increase access to more users</li>
	<li>someone provides feedback about legal or ethical aspects</li>
	<li>the data is used in new ways</li>
</ul>
