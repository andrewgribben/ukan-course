	<p>Sometimes even when you follow all the recommended advice things can go wrong. As we have already said - the risk of disclosure is not zero (although it should be remote). With this in mind it is important that you put in place mechanisms that can help you deal with a data breach if, in the rare event, one were to occur.</p>
	
	<p>
Developing a breaches policy is crucial – it should essentially capture:
	</p>
	
	<ol class="lower-roman">
		<li>what you mean by a breach,</li>
		<li>identify critical factors that might lead to a breach such as non-compliance of data security policies and procedures, error, malicious intrusion.</li>
		<li>the penalties associated with critical factors and a breach</li>
		<li>identity who is responsible for doing what, when and how. </li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>
	Don’t forget – you need to ensure all the appropriate employees know about and understand what their responsibilities are such as strict compliance with data handling/sharing and IT security policies and procedures.
